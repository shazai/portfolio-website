**Personal Portfolio**  
A responsive personal portfolio built with semantic HTML, Bootstrap, custom CSS, and mobile-first design.

Additional project cards are included as placeholders for future work.

### Contact
Includes a contact form with fields for:

- Name
- Email address
- Message

The current form is for front-end demonstration only and does not send messages until it is connected to a backend or form service.

## Responsive Design

The portfolio follows a mobile-first approach.

Custom media queries are used at:

- `576px` — large phones
- `768px` — tablets
- `992px` — small laptops
- `1200px` — large desktops

Bootstrap responsive classes are also used so layouts can stack on small screens and expand into multiple columns on larger screens.

## Project Structure

```text
personal-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── css/

├── images/

├── README.md
└── DEPLOYMENT.md
```

## Setup / Viewing Instructions

### Option 1: Open Locally

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Make sure `index.html`, `css/style.css`, and the `images/` folder are present.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Because Bootstrap is loaded through a CDN, an internet connection is needed for Bootstrap styling and the collapsible navigation JavaScript.

### Option 2: Clone with Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/personal-portfolio.git
cd personal-portfolio
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser.
